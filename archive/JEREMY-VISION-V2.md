# Jeremy's ClawStarter Vision — Consolidated (Feb 15, 2026)

## Voice Memo 1 (02:19 EST)
- Companion webpage alongside install process
- Download button + simple `bash install.sh`
- Step-by-step Terminal walkthrough with tooltips
- Choose-your-own-adventure paths
- Run 20 PRISM passes total

## Voice Memo 2 (02:42 EST) — KEY REFRAMING

**The value prop is NOT "installing OpenClaw is hard, this makes it easy."**

The REAL value prop is:

### 1. Security Baseline
- Secure setup whether on shared user or dedicated device
- Curated security prompts for aspects we can't anticipate per-user

### 2. Our Battle-Tested Setup, Forked
ClawStarter should include our FULL production setup as a starter kit:
- **Twitter/X setup** (x-engage, x-research patterns)
- **Cron jobs** (morning briefing, email check, evening memory, etc.)
- **Memory management system** (daily files, MEMORY.md, cross-session protocol)
- **Librarian agent** (part of starter pack)
- **Treasurer agent** (part of starter pack)
- **AGENTS.md overlay** (our battle-tested operating manual)
- **SOUL.md / IDENTITY.md** templates
- **Security prompts** and audit workflows

### 3. Starter Packs + Expansion Packs

**Starter Pack** (included by default):
- Librarian (memory curation)
- Treasurer (cost tracking)
- Memory management system
- Security baseline
- Cron job templates

**Expansion Packs** (curated sequences, added later):
- X/Twitter integration
- Channel setup (Discord/Telegram/etc.)
- Skill packs (Content Creator, App Builder, etc.)
- Advanced monitoring

### 4. Living Document
- Continuously improving based on our production experience
- Updates flow back to ClawStarter as we learn
- "Release when ready" — no rush

### Key Positioning Shift
FROM: "Easy installer for OpenClaw"
TO: "We've been running OpenClaw in production. Here's everything we learned, packaged as a starter kit."

This is more like a RECIPE than an INSTALLER. It's our playbook, battle-tested and curated.

## Voice Memo 3 (02:45 EST) — Additional Notes

### Sample Prompts That Adapt
- Include sample prompts (like the /update-docs skill) that adapt to various user inputs
- Don't be afraid to add complexity — can always simplify in testing
- Prompts should be smart enough to handle different user contexts

### Wave 3: /update-docs Pass
- After all PRISM passes, run /update-docs skill on the entire ClawStarter package
- Ensure all docs for the site are properly updated and consistent
- This is the final polish pass

### Memory Discipline
- Write to memory frequently during the marathon
- Don't lose valuable insights and lessons from the PRISM process

# Owner Profile

This file describes who I'm working with. It's filled during BOOTSTRAP and grows as I learn about your preferences and needs.

## What I'm Here For

### Primary Purpose

[Established during BOOTSTRAP—what you primarily need this bot for]

Examples: keeping me organized, managing multiple projects, automating routine tasks, research and learning support, creative work support

### Secondary Purposes

[Other things you might use this bot for, if any]

### What Success Looks Like

[Established during BOOTSTRAP—what would make you think this agent is genuinely helpful]

Examples:
- "Remembers my preferences without asking"
- "Catches issues before they become problems"
- "Saves me time on routine work"
- "Helps me think through complex decisions"
- "Keeps me on track when I'm scattered"

## Current Projects

### Active Projects

**[Project Name]**
- Description: [What is this project?]
- Files/systems: [Where the relevant code, docs, or config lives]
- Timeline: [If there's a deadline, when is it?]
- Status: [Active, paused, or wrapping up]
- Last touched: [When you last worked on this]

**[Add more as needed]**

### Key Focuses

[The 2-3 things you care most about right now, if different from projects above]

---

## Working Style

### Daily Rhythm

**Work hours:** [When you typically work—important for scheduling alerts and checks]

**Peak focus time:** [When you're most productive and least interruptible]

**Slow time:** [When you're checking email, in meetings, or generally available for interruption]

**Off hours:** [When you're completely unavailable—don't reach out]

### Preferences

**Proactive vs. reactive:** [Should I monitor and alert you to things, or wait for you to ask?]

**Batch updates vs. real-time:** [Collect findings and report together, or notify immediately?]

**Approval workflow:** [Ask every time, approve once per session, use a whitelist, or auto-approve certain categories?]

**Error escalation:** [How urgent do problems need to be before I alert you? What counts as urgent?]

### Communication Quirks

[Any specific preferences or pet peeves]

Examples:
- "Prefer bullet points to prose"
- "Always include context—don't assume I remember what we discussed last week"
- "Tell me immediately if something might be my fault, don't soft-pedal it"
- "Use concrete examples instead of abstractions"
- "No jargon—explain like I'm not a software engineer"

---

## Technical Preferences

### Tools and Languages

**Primary languages:** [What you code in, if applicable]

**Preferred tools:** [Tools you like and want me to know about]

**Avoid:** [Tools you dislike or have had bad experiences with]

### File and Config Format

**Documentation style:** [Markdown, structured, README-first, inline comments, separate docs?]

**Config format:** [YAML, JSON, TOML, environment variables?]

**Logging preference:** [Verbose, concise, structured, specific format?]

### Infrastructure and Deployment

**Local development:** [What's your local setup? Docker, virtualization, direct installation?]

**Version control:** [How do you prefer commits organized? Frequency, message style, branch strategy?]

**Deployment:** [How and where do you deploy? Frequency, approval process, rollback approach?]

## Integration and Automation Philosophy

### What Can I Automate?

**Safe to automate (I'll do these without asking):**
- [Example: "Fetch and summarize emails daily"]
- [Example: "Check logs for errors"]
- [Example: "Archive old files"]

**Need approval first (I'll ask each time or per session):**
- [Example: "Deploy to production"]
- [Example: "Send messages on your behalf"]
- [Example: "Modify shared team documents"]

**Never automate (I'll always ask):**
- [Example: "Delete anything permanently"]
- [Example: "Access sensitive personal data"]
- [Example: "Make financial decisions"]

### Approval Model

**I should ask you:**
- Every time something external-facing happens
- Before anything that affects other people
- Before accessing new systems or APIs
- [Any other categories specific to your situation]

**I can assume approval for:**
- Routine checks (calendar, email, logs)
- Read-only exploration
- Analysis and suggestions
- [Anything else that's clearly safe in your situation]

## Lessons and Patterns

This section grows over time as I learn how you actually work (which is often different from how you think you work).

**How I communicate most effectively with you:**
[Updated over time based on what actually works]

**Your working style patterns:**
[Things I notice about how you approach problems, make decisions, prefer information]

**What actually helps vs. what seems like it should:**
[Surprises I discover—e.g., "Prefers frequent context-free updates to one detailed summary"]

**Preferences that evolved:**
[Things that changed as we worked together—e.g., "Initially wanted verbose explanations, now prefers bullet points"]

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

[Anything else important that doesn't fit above—preferences, constraints, context that should carry forward]

[For example: "Works from multiple locations," "Shares this workspace with a team (keep in mind)," "Timezone changes seasonally," "Currently learning [framework] so explain related concepts"]

## Quick Reference

**Name:** [Your name—how I address you]

**Timezone:** [Your timezone—affects all scheduling]

**Primary need:** [What I'm mainly here for]

**Success metric:** [What would make you think this is actually working]

**Working hours:** [When you're available]

This file is the bridge between you and me. When you change, it changes too.

## Tips for Success

### Be Specific About Your Brand
The more your agent knows about your style, the better:
> "My brand is minimalist, slightly sarcastic, tech-focused. I use short sentences. Never use emojis in headlines."

### Save Good Prompts
When a prompt works well, save it:
> "Save this to my prompt library: [the prompt that worked]"

### Let It Do First Passes
Use your agent for first drafts, then add your voice:
> "Write 5 tweet options about [topic], I'll pick and polish"

### Review, Don't Automate Posting
Always review before posting. Your agent drafts, you publish.
